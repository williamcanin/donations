# Donations

Here you can make donations of any amount to keep the project active.
The price of a coffee already helps us. :coffee:

You can choose one of the shapes below:

<div class="donation">
<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Using PayPal (USD)</th>
      <th>Bitcoin Address (Lightning)</th>
      <th>Bitcoin QR Code (Lightning)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=YBK2HEEYG8V5W&source" target="_blank">
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamcanin/donations/main/svg/banks/paypal.svg" alt="PayPal Donation"/>
        </a>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p align="center"> williamcanin@blink.sv</p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamcanin/donations/main/qrcodes/blink.jpg" width="120" alt="QR Code Lightning"/>
      </td>
   </tr>
    <!-- <tr>
      <td>
      </td>
      <td>
      <p align="center">Click <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamcanin/donations/main/images/qrcode_btc.png" target="_blank">here</a> to donate with QR Code</p>
      </td>
    </tr> -->
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

## How will you know I made the donation?

After the donation, create an [issue](https://github.com/williamcanin/donations/issues) stating your
name in the title, and in the description which project you made the donation and the date of the
donation, so that we can have the control which project received the donation, and your name in the
project's CONTRIBUTING.md.
